File-Type-Clearout
==================

File Type Clearout is a simple application that is able to quickly move through a deep folder structure and delete all files apart from those file types specified by the user. The clearing process is recursive in nature, meaning that all subdirectories will be processed.  Created by Craig Lotter, November 2005
